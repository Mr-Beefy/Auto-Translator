# Auto Translate Tool

Welcome to the Auto Translate Tool! This tool automatically translates messages from one language to another based on your selected settings.

## How to Use
1. **Download and Extract the Files**:
   - Download the tool and extract it to a folder on your computer.
   - Inside the folder, you will find the `Translate_MAIN.exe` file and the `settings.json` file.

2. **Set the Perimeter and Chat Bar**:
   - When you first run the tool, you need to **define the region** that the tool will read for messages (perimeter).
   - Additionally, you need to **set the chat bar** where the translated messages will be typed.

   ### How to Set Perimeter:
   - Click on the **"Set Perimeter"** button.
   - You will be prompted to hover your mouse over the **top-left corner** of the area you want to scan and **hold for 2 seconds**. This defines the starting point of the region.
   - Next, hover your mouse over the **bottom-right corner** of the region you want to set and **hold for 2 seconds**. This defines the ending point of the region.
   - The coordinates of the perimeter will automatically be saved in the settings.

   ### How to Set Chat Bar:
   - Click on the **"Set Chat Bar"** button.
   - Hover your mouse over the area where you want the tool to type translated messages (usually the chat input box in the application).
   - Hold your mouse for **2 seconds** to set the coordinates.
   - The chat bar coordinates will be saved in the settings.

3. **Select Your Language and Translate**:
   - Choose your **source language** and the **target language** for translation in the dropdown menus.
   - You can then either type a message or paste one in the input field, and the tool will translate it automatically.

4. **Auto Send**:
   - If you check the **Auto Send** option, the translated message will be automatically typed into the chat bar and sent.

5. **Clear Chat**:
   - Use the **Delete Chat** button to clear the chat window after translation.

6. **Auto Clear Timer**:
   - Set an **Auto Clear Timer** in seconds to automatically clear the chat window after a specified amount of time.

## How the Tool Works
- The tool will scan the defined region (perimeter) for new messages, translate them based on the selected language, and type the translated text into the chat bar.
- The tool uses the Google Translate API for translation and utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) to read the messages from the specified region.

## Important Notes:
- **Region Setup**: You must define the perimeter by setting the **top-left** and **bottom-right** corners of the area to scan. To do this, hover over the **top-left corner** and **hold for 2 seconds**, then move to the **bottom-right corner** and **hold for 2 seconds**. Make sure you do this for both corners to define the perimeter correctly.
- **Chat Bar Setup**: Similarly, the tool requires you to define the area where it will type the translated message by holding the mouse for 2 seconds.
- **Resolution**: The tool is set to work at 1920x1080 resolution by default, but you can adjust this in the settings if needed.


THIS PROGRAM IS COMPLETLY SAFE TO USE, and I understand the concerns that arise when Windows flags an executable file. Windows flags most .exe files created by independent developers as a precaution, especially when they aren’t digitally signed. However, I want to assure you there is no malicious intent behind this program.

To verify the program’s safety, you can scan it using online tools such as VirusTotal. VirusTotal is a trusted website where you can upload the executable file, and it will run checks through multiple antivirus engines to confirm that the program is clean.

Instructions to Run the Program After Windows Flags It
If Windows flags the program and you are confident it’s safe (as you’ve verified through VirusTotal or similar tools), you can follow these steps to bypass the warning:

When Windows Defender SmartScreen pops up with a warning, click "More info".
Then click the "Run anyway" button to execute the program.
(Optional) Add the program to your antivirus’s or Windows Defender’s exclusion list to prevent further warnings.
Additional Notes
If you have any further concerns, feel free to reach out through the support section provided with the program. Transparency and user trust are my priorities, and I’m here to address any questions you may have.
